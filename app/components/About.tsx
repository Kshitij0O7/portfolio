        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">
          Born in Amritsar, I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Goa, with a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering. 
          This technical foundation launched my journey into software, first as a Software Development Engineer and now as a Developer 
          Relations professional. I'm currently building my own startup, driven by a passion for bridging the gap between complex 
          technology and the developers who use it. I thrive on creating SDKs, tutorials, and documentation that empower technical 
          communities. Now, I'm channeling that experience into creating products that not only solve real-world problems but are also 
          a joy for developers to use.
